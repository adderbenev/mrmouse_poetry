# mrmouse_poetry
This code was created as a part of a master's project at Hochschule Darmstadt, Expanded Media program.
Created by Anton (Maarangam) Derbenev

The idea of this code is to create audio files that sound like those annoying led stripes in cheap shopping malls that roll their useless adverts 
so fast that I can never really read them from the first try.

I am working on a sci-fi world so to me it is relevant:)
I have included one of the resulting tracks in the repo, so if you are looking for a bewildering soundscape for a psychic asylum for the outdated AIs...
...feel free to use it. 

And kindly let me know, because if you like this - we are friends. 

FUNCTIONING

It's my first code in my life:) But it works, on Windows 11, version 22H2, Visual Studio, Python 3.10.11
It goes to the websites specified in the list, chooses some read, makes a news feed, and leaves only headlines, four headlines to be exact, but it is all adjustable.
Then it addresses DataMuse API, looks for rhymes, and replaces random words in a line with something that rhymes together. 
No grammar, no complications, no commas, no dots...
Then it voices this self-composed ditty with a classic voice, that sounds like a female robot. Unless you tune it down several steps.
And finally, the only thing that I managed to steal from a decent coder - the autotune.
Autotune comes from here.

If curiosity drives you to use this code, you will need some songs to autotune the poetic verses to.
For that matter, we need a separate folder with musical extracts. 
As I noted these extracts work better when there is just voice on the recording you are tuning to.
High pitches and super low pitches are not the best picks. 
Susana Vega's Tom Dinner worked beautifully. She is apparently the divine protector of all digital progects. 

The code will process any length file as input. But I would recommend slicing them up to increase speed and accuracy. 
Accuracy is hardly the right word here though. Originally, the autotune was meant for its classic purpose - 
to make one sound file closer to another file... that is close enough already.
When it is applied to a monotonous robotic voice - autotune makes the track soar and dive like a high eagle taking off from a peyote cactus. 


THE BEST OF AUTOTUNING PRACTICES

You can actually take the above-mentioned autotune and try to autotune two normal songs between themselves. 
It is just funny, like a broken radio. 
And it is also funny that you can spoil Wagner by Bach.
